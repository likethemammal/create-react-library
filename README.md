## Converted to custom setup

Moved all dependencies to dev dependencies because we don't need extra dependencies for our library after build, but we want all this features while developing: 

* React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* A dev server that lints for common errors.
* Import CSS and image files directly from JavaScript.
* Autoprefixed CSS, so you donâ€™t need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
* A `build` script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production.
